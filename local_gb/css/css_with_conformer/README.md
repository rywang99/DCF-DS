The code under this directory is mostly a copy of "CSS with Conformer" from the original repo at the URL below.
Some extentions were made when adopting to NOTSOFAR.

We didn't copy the README.md file from the original repo because it contains Shared Access Signatures (SAS) that
are considered secrets by some version control systems. One can find the original README.md file at the URL below.
